Preparing the database
----------------------

Run aggregate_player_stats.sql to build the player_mv table the first time.
Run player_stats_triggers.sql to set up the triggers.

player_stats_triggers.sql must be run as a user with appropriate privileges to
modify the player_mv table

# mysql -u user bf_stats < aggregate_player_stats.sql
# mysql -u user bf_stats < player_stats_triggers.sql

Both scripts can be run multiple times harmlessly

Once both scripts have been run, all future insertions relevant to the
player_mv table will automatically update it.

Deploying the web pages
-----------------------

Running `util/deploy.sh` will attempt to scp all needed files to a configured
host and directory. These are configured via three variables at the top of the
file; no other edits should be necessary as long as your ssh_config has been
set up properly.

Configuring DB Access
---------------------
All DB access information is configured in db_functions.php

# cp db_functions.php.changeme db_functions.php
# vim db_functions.php

After these steps you should be hot to trot

(Optional) Seeding the DB
-------------------------

A small seed of data is available under the `seed/` directory. With
# mysql -u user bf_stats < seed/smallseed.sql                            
you can get a working fixture of data to test with, although the associated
dates will need to be doctored, or your system clock set back
